LSST Binary Distribution Installer and Updater
==============================================

A quick'n'dirty utility for distributing DM stack binaries using rsync, in
absence of such functionality in EUPS.

lsst-distrib detects the OS, checks for prerequisites, and if the user is
running a known OS, and has all prerequisites installed, rsyncs a pre-built
binary distribution to the user's machine.

lsst-distrib
------------

Clones a pre-built binary distribution of the LSST Data Management
Software Stack.

Usage:

        ./bin/lsst-distrib [-h|--help] [update|install] [dest_dir]

Running with no command line arguments is equivalent to running
'lsst-distrib install'.

Arguments:
install		Install the binary distribution of DM stack
update		Update an existing binary distribution install

dest_dir	EXPERIMENTAL: Install the stack to <destdir>, rather
                than the directory it was originally built in. This
                is an experimental feature and may cause some
                misbehavior.
