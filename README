LSST Binary Distribution Installer and Updater
==============================================

A quick'n'dirty utility for distributing DM stack binaries using rsync, in
absence of such functionality in EUPS. 

lsst-distrib detects the OS, checks for prerequisites, and if the user is
running a known OS, and has all prerequisites installed, rsyncs a pre-built
binary distribution to the user's machine.

By default, it installs into /opt/lsst (where the binaries have been built).
There's an experimental feature to install to an arbitrary directory, but it
hasn't been exhaustively verified to work (e.g., it's not known if all of
the code used by the stack is relocatable).

The intended workflow for a new installation is:

	curl -O http://moya.dev.lsstcorp.org/lsst-distrib
	bash lsst-distrib install

Installing to a non-standard directory:

	curl -O https://moya.lsst.majuric.org/lsst-distrib
	bash lsst-distrib install /non/standard/directory

Updating an existing installation:

	setup lsst_distrib_tools
	lsst-distrib update
